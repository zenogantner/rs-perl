TODO: add (c) notes in the directories

Simple recommender system framework in Perl, developed for my Master's thesis
in 2006/2007, with some later changes.
Contains an implementation of George and Merugu's coclustering-based
CF method, plus Naive Bayes and some baseline recommenders.

This software is quite old: it is obsolete, that is not actively developed nor supported.
I have put this on GitHub for purely for archiving reasons.
Feel free to read the code, run it, play with it, but don't expect too much in terms of
functionality ;-),
Also, please do not use this code to judge my current Perl coding style/skills...

If you are looking for serious collections of recommender system algorithms,
have a look at MyMediaLite -- http://github.com/zenogantner/mymedialite --
or Apache Mahout.
